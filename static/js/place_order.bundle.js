/* 
Your built code should go here, think of this as the build or dist folder (/static/js),
although to be honest I'd prefer to have a separate directory named like that and not put the
built code here inside static, but I'm just keeping it here because I don't want to use an
absolute path inside the template and because I don't want a whole new folder for just a
single file ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
